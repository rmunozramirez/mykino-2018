Jasper accidentally destroyed the \r\ninfant’s address beacon and went into exile. Unable to deliver the \r\norphaned girl, the storks adopted her under the name Tulip. CEO stork \r\nHunter discontinued baby delivery in favor of package delivery with \r\nCornerstore.com.\r\n</p><p>Eighteen years later, Tulip, now a young adult, tries to promote \r\nnew ideas for Cornerstore, which backfire and cause the company to lose \r\nstocks. Hunter declares her to be a severe burden and liability due to \r\nthis incompetence (the charts even justify this, as every time she tries\r\n to help, their profits go way down, and when they <i>do</i> make \r\nprogress, it is when she\'s absent). Hunter assigns top delivery stork \r\nJunior to fire Tulip so he may be promoted to boss. Junior cannot bring \r\nhimself to do so and instead transfers Tulip to the mail room.\r\n</p><p>Meanwhile, a young boy named Nate Gardner, who lives with his \r\nworkaholic parents Henry and Sarah, is feeling lonely and wants a \r\nyounger sibling. He sends a letter to Cornerstore and it reaches Tulip, \r\nwho enters the defunct baby factory and inserts the letter into the \r\nbaby-making machine, causing it to create a pink-haired infant girl. \r\nJunior injures his wing trying to shut down the machine. Afraid Hunter \r\nwill fire him, Junior agrees to accompany Tulip and secretly deliver the\r\n baby to her family using a makeshift flying craft that Tulip invented. \r\nThey eventually crash, escape a pack of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_wolf\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gray wolf\">wolves</a>\r\n that fall in love with the baby, and reach civilization, during which \r\nJunior and Tulip bond with the baby and name her Diamond Destiny. In the\r\n meantime, Henry and Sarah open up to Nate’s desire for a younger \r\nsibling and spend time with their son by building a landing platform for\r\n the storks.\r\n</p><p>Junior and Tulip encounter Jasper, who had followed them from \r\nStork Mountain. Jasper has nearly repaired Tulip’s delivery beacon, but \r\nis missing one piece, which had been in Tulip’s possession for years. \r\nJunior confesses to Tulip that he was supposed to fire her, and a \r\nsaddened Tulip leaves with Jasper to meet her family while Junior \r\ncontinues alone to deliver Diamond Destiny. Cornerstore’s pigeon \r\nemployee Toady learns about Diamond Destiny and informs Hunter, who \r\nreroutes her address beacon and leads Junior into a trap. Hunter fires \r\nJunior and has Diamond Destiny taken away to live with penguins until \r\nshe is an adult in order to silence the incident and prevent more \r\nplummeting stocks.\r\n</p><p>Tulip reunites with Junior and they return to Stork Mountain \r\nduring the highly anticipated Storkcon event to save Diamond Destiny \r\nfrom the penguins. When they are cornered in the baby factory by Hunter \r\nand the other stork employees, Junior sends millions of archived letters\r\n from families into the baby-making machine, causing it to rapidly \r\nproduce babies and distract the storks. Hunter seizes control of a giant\r\n crane and tries to destroy the factory, only to have Diamond Destiny \r\nand abused birds help make the Cornerstore building collapse off Stork \r\nMountain, causing Hunter, who is entangled in the building cables and \r\ntrapped inside the crane, to fall to his death.\r\n</p><p>In the aftermath, Junior rallies the storks to deliver all the \r\nbabies to their families. Junior, Tulip, and Jasper deliver Diamond \r\nDestiny to the Gardners, Tulip finally meets her family, and Junior and \r\nTulip continue working as co-bosses at Stork Mountain.\r\n</p>', 'storks', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZENmkJk9fBM', '2016-09-23', '01:27:00', 1, 1, 3, '2018-08-25 12:11:11', '2018-08-25 12:11:11', NULL),

Paddington chases the thief, who escapes, and \r\nPaddington is framed and arrested. Although Mr. Gruber and the Browns do\r\n not believe that Paddington stole the book, with no evidence that the \r\nthief even existed, Paddington is wrongfully convicted and jailed. The \r\nthief soon returns home and is revealed to be Phoenix Buchanan, an \r\negotistical actor who lives opposite the Browns.\r\n</p><p>Whilst in prison, Paddington befriends many of the inmates, \r\nincluding the short-tempered chef Knuckles, who hires Paddington, \r\nimpressed by his marmalade sandwich recipe. The Browns work to clear \r\nPaddington\'s name, putting up sketches of the thief. Buchanan begins \r\nusing the pop-up book to locate a series of clues within London\'s famous\r\n landmarks, which he believes will unveil the location of a secret \r\ntreasure, wearing a different disguise for each visit. During their \r\nefforts to prove Paddington\'s innocence, the Browns encounter a fortune \r\nteller who informs them that the stolen book leads to the hidden fortune\r\n of the original author. They start investigating the landmarks on the \r\npopup book and discover a suspicious character (Buchanan) has been \r\nvisiting each one as well.\r\n</p><p>With Paddington inside, the prison is a much livelier place, but \r\nPaddington struggles to remain positive when the Browns are unable to \r\nprove his innocence but keep hunting. Becoming convinced that Buchanan \r\nis the culprit, the Browns look for the stolen book inside his house. \r\nThey find a secret attic where Buchanan\'s various costumes are stashed, \r\nas well as the book itself, discovering that each of the suspicious \r\ncharacters visiting the landmarks were Buchanan. Before they can act \r\nfurther, Buchanan returns home and suspects something is wrong. \r\nMeanwhile, the Browns reveal what they have discovered to the police, \r\nonly to be informed that they need stronger evidence, such as the book \r\nwith his fingerprints on it, to prove that he is guilty. They miss a \r\nprison visit with Paddington, causing Paddington to believe that the \r\nBrowns have forgotten all about him.\r\n</p><p>Paddington then reluctantly takes part in a prison break \r\nalongside several other inmates, including Knuckles, who promises to aid\r\n in proving his innocence but promptly abandons the idea in order to \r\nleave the country as a free man, inviting Paddington to come with him. \r\nPaddington refuses and, whilst roaming the streets and avoiding the \r\npolice, uses a public telephone to contact the Browns, who assert that \r\nBuchanan is the real culprit. To catch him, they arrange to meet at \r\nPaddington Station, where a train carrying the supposed location of the \r\nhidden fortune is due to leave shortly.\r\n</p><p>Paddington reaches the station and makes it onto the train just \r\nas it leaves - the Browns begin their pursuit on another steam train at \r\nthe opposite platform. When caught up, Henry Brown and Mrs. Bird board \r\nthe other train and confront Buchanan, who overwhelms them and makes \r\ngood his initial escape. Paddington is left trapped in the train\'s rear \r\ncarriage, the coupling of which Buchanan severs and switches down a \r\ndifferent track, leaving it to crash into a nearby river. Mary Brown \r\ntries to rescue Paddington but struggles to open the locked carriage; \r\nshe is soon assisted by Knuckles and the other inmates, who have a \r\nchange of heart and decide to help Paddington as promised. Eventually, \r\nHenry knocks out Buchanan just as he tries to access the so-called \r\ntreasure, and he is promptly taken into custody.\r\n</p><p>Paddington, now declared innocent, becomes very ill after the \r\nevents, slipping into a short three-day coma yet recovering upon waking \r\nup on Aunt Lucy\'s birthday. With the book taken in as evidence by the \r\npolice, Paddington is disappointed that he was unable to buy Lucy a \r\npresent as promised, though soon discovers the Browns, with the help of \r\nvarious other people in the neighbourhood, made sure Lucy could come to \r\nLondon and see it for herself. When answering the door to her, \r\nPaddington rushes up and hugs her, wishing her a happy birthday.\r\n</p><p>Meanwhile, Knuckles and the other escaped prisoners are pardoned,\r\n and Buchanan is sentenced to 10 years in prison for his crimes and \r\nframing Paddington.

Pete’s mom and dad are killed, but Pete survives the \r\naccident and is chased into the forest by a pack of wolves. He is \r\nrescued by a huge dragon with green fur, yellow eyes, and wings. The \r\ndragon quickly bonds with Pete and becomes protective of the boy. Pete \r\nnames the dragon \"Elliot\" after the character of a lost puppy from his \r\nfavorite book.\r\n</p><p>Six years later, Pete, now 11, spots a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumberjack\" title=\"Lumberjack\">lumberjack</a>\r\n crew chopping down trees near his home. Natalie, the daughter of the \r\nethical site foreman Jack, spots and chases him. When Natalie \r\naccidentally falls from a tree, her screams attract her father Jack and \r\nhis girlfriend, park ranger Grace Meacham. Pete tries to run away, but \r\nGavin, Jack\'s pragmatic brother, accidentally knocks him unconscious. \r\nAfter realizing that Pete has vanished, Elliot stumbles around looking \r\nfor him and ends up knocking over a tree near the lumber camp, leading \r\nGavin to organize a hunting party to find him. Meanwhile, Pete wakes up \r\nin a local hospital, which he escapes in an effort to return to the \r\nforest. Before the police can catch the boy, Grace finds Pete and asks \r\nhim to come to her home and promises to take him to the forest the next \r\nday.\r\n</p><p>Gavin and his men locate Pete and Elliot\'s treehouse, but when \r\nthey try to search it, Elliot reveals himself and scares them away. He \r\nfollows them to town trying to find Pete. After seeing Pete settling in \r\nwith Grace\'s family, he leaves. After Pete gives Grace a drawing of \r\nElliot, she shows her father, Mr. Meacham. He says that he discovered \r\nthe same dragon as a young man. He advises her to trust Pete, and to \r\nfind Elliot.\r\n</p><p>The next day, Pete, Grace, Natalie, and Mr. Meacham travel to the\r\n forest to meet Elliot. A group of hunters led by Gavin surprise Elliot \r\nand shoot him with tranquilizer darts, then lock him up in Jack\'s \r\nwarehouse. Before the authorities can inspect the dragon, Pete and \r\nNatalie free him from his chains and escape on a lumber truck with Mr. \r\nMeacham.\r\n</p><p>Angered, Gavin sets up a roadblock at the bridge to stop them. \r\nWhen Elliot tries to fly, he crashes into the truck, damaging its brakes\r\n and it goes through the barricade. Confused and frightened, Elliot \r\nperches on top of the bridge and starts breathing fire at the police. \r\nThe bridge begins to collapse under the intense heat, causing Grace and \r\nJack\'s truck to fall through. Gavin tries to save the pair from falling \r\nto their deaths. Elliot emerges from the ravine with Grace and Jack \r\nriding safely on his back. With a firefighting helicopter approaching, \r\nPete decides to flee with Elliot back to the woods.\r\n</p><p>Pete pleads with Elliot to let him stay so he can protect him \r\nfrom his attackers, just as Elliot protected him. However, Elliot \r\nconcludes that as long as they stay close together, Pete will always be \r\nin danger. He points out Pete\'s book to encourage him to return to stay \r\nwith Grace and Jack. Pete is reluctant &amp; worried for Elliott\'s \r\nsafety, but ultimately trusts the dragon\'s judgment. After a very \r\ntearful hug, Elliot returns to the mountains and Pete returns to live \r\nwith Grace and Jack as his new family.\r\n</p><p>In the years that follow, Grace and Jack marry and adopt Pete as \r\ntheir son. Not only has Elliot slowly faded from the town\'s memory, but \r\nGavin has learned to be more scrupulous and has moved on from the \r\nexperience.

His problems also extend to his private life; \r\nhis girlfriend Linda\'s ex-boyfriend Andrew is still close friends with \r\nher and is condescending to Dave at work.\r\n</p><p>While flying to a business meeting, a series of annoyances from a flight attendant and a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_marshal\" title=\"Sky marshal\">sky marshal</a> cause Dave to lose his temper.

Dave is then arrested for assaulting the flight attendant and sentenced to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anger_management\" title=\"Anger management\">anger management</a>\r\n therapy. The therapist is Buddy Rydell, who is revealed to be the man \r\nDave sat next to on the plane. Buddy\'s unorthodox techniques cause Dave \r\nto lose his temper, and Buddy tells Dave he recognizes his problem as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive-aggressive_behavior\" title=\"Passive-aggressive behavior\">passive-aggressive anger</a>.\r\n When Dave is sent back to court, Buddy intervenes on his behalf \r\nchoosing to move in with Dave and shadow him in his life as part of more\r\n intensive therapy. Failure to comply will result in a year of jail time\r\n for Dave. Although Dave believes that co-worker Andrew is doing nothing\r\n to ruin him at work, Buddy suspects otherwise and tells him that he \r\nneeds to start fighting back or nothing will change. After receiving a \r\nphone call for Buddy informing him his mother is undergoing minor \r\nsurgery in Boston, Dave jokes to him about its seriousness, prompting \r\nBuddy to warn he\'ll get Dave back with another practical joke.\r\n</p><p>The two drive to Boston, after in anger, smashing and destroying a\r\n car that was blocking Buddy\'s in a parking garage. After seeing Buddy\'s\r\n mother, the two stop at a restaurant on the way back to New York. After\r\n Buddy pressures him, Dave flirts and goes home with a beautiful young \r\nlady he sees at the bar, but then at her home, rejects her amorous \r\nadvances out of loyalty to Linda. Later, Dave is devastated to learn \r\nthat Buddy has told   Linda on the phone about the woman, but Buddy \r\nexplains the woman was a former patient of his, having set up the \r\nencounter to get revenge on Dave for the \"dying mother\" prank. The next \r\nmorning, Buddy apologizes to Dave and says he explained everything to \r\nLinda. Buddy and Dave then take a detour to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_temple\" title=\"Buddhist temple\">Buddhist temple</a>,\r\n so that Dave can confront a reformed Arnie, who has become a monk. \r\nWhile confronting his tormentor at outdoor group meditation, Arnie \r\nexpresses his sincerest apologies to Dave for bullying him, but he \r\nlaughs when Dave reminds him of the kiss incident. Buddy and an \r\ninitially hesitant Dave provoke Arnie by lying about Dave having \r\nmolested Arnie\'s mentally ill sister, and Dave and Arnie fight. Buddy \r\nteases the monks into a rage and the two are chased off the grounds, \r\nwith Dave feeling good on having confronted his tormentor. Back in New \r\nYork, Dave attempts to propose to Linda but loses his nerve, and Linda \r\nsuggests that they take a break from their relationship. Soon after \r\nBuddy begins dating Linda, Dave sees this as the last straw and loses \r\nhis cool by attacking Buddy. Being called back into court, Dave is given\r\n a restraining order by the judge, who threatens to lock him up if Dave \r\nhas another incident.\r\n</p><p>Called into work and yelled at by his boss, Dave finally snaps \r\nwhen he learns that his boss intentionally passed him up and gave the \r\npromotion to Andrew. Dave calls Andrew out for trying to interfere with \r\nboth his promotion and relationship with Linda, revealing he wants \r\nAndrew out of their lives forever. When Andrew attempts to insult him by\r\n claiming he needed Buddy to back him up, Dave knocks him out cold. \r\nUsing Buddy\'s advice, he proceeds to humiliate his boss by using a golf \r\nclub to wreck his office and reminding him of all the years of his loyal\r\n services just to be denied of the promotion he wanted so much. Dave \r\nthen tells his boss that if he gets out of jail within the next two to \r\nfive years, he expects his boss to do the right thing and give him the \r\npromotion that Andrew presumably resigned from. His boss agrees and Dave\r\n deliberately steps on Andrew\'s head as he leaves. Before leaving, Dave \r\ntells his boss off that he should never insult his cat, Meatball, again \r\nunless he wants the cat to finish up eating all his crab cakes and leave\r\n a mess in his office. Learning from Andrew that Buddy has taken Linda \r\nto a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees\" title=\"New York Yankees\">New York Yankees</a>\r\n game, Dave assumes Buddy intends to steal his proposal idea and races \r\nto the stadium. Security captures him and begins to remove him from the \r\nstadium but Mayor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani\" title=\"Rudy Giuliani\">Rudy Giuliani</a>\r\n orders them to allow Dave to speak. After admitting that he does have \r\nan anger problem and is willing to change, Dave agrees to kiss Linda in \r\nfront of the stadium in exchange for her marrying him. Linda and Buddy \r\nthen reveal that the game was the final part of Dave\'s therapy, and \r\nexplain that the tormentors and aggravations he has been put through \r\nwere Buddy\'s doing to teach him how to unleash his anger in healthy \r\ndoses to avoid it building up. The passenger, the Judge, the waitress, \r\nand the flight attendant are all Buddy\'s friends, while the sky marshal \r\nwho tased him was just having a bad day.\r\n</p><p>The three attend a picnic with Buddy\'s other patients, where Dave\r\n plays a final joke on Buddy with a friend holding the group up with a  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_gun\" title=\"Water gun\">water pistol</a>, and the film ends as the friends sing \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Feel_Pretty\" title=\"I Feel Pretty\">I Feel Pretty</a>\" from <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Side_Story\" title=\"West Side Story\">West Side Story</a></i> together.\r\n</p>', 'anger-management', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/DzUc3Eqzzos', '2003-04-11', '01:46:00', 3, 1, 4, '2018-08-25 17:46:21', '2018-08-25 17:46:21', NULL),
